# 👋 Hi there!

I'm a student at KOSEN (National Institute of Technology) in Japan.

💻 Programming is my passion, and I'm excited to share my journey here on GitHub!

🌱 Currently learning:
- Flutter for cross-platform app development
- Rust for system programming
- React for web development
- I don't use GitHub much these days, so I may not be able to contact you.
